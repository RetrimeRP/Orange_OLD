MANUAL!
HOW TO USE MySQL FOR DARKRP!
Download andyvincent's/Drakehawke's gm_MySQL OO module and read the guide here:
http://www.facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1220537


WHAT TO DO IF YOU CAN'T GET IT TO WORK!
    - There are always errors on the server, try if you can see those (with HLDS)
    - the same errors are also in the logs if you can't find the errors on the server.
        the logs are at garrysmod/data/DarkRP_logs/ on the SERVER!
        The MySQL lines in the log always precede with "MySQL Error:" (without the quotation marks)
    - make sure the settings in this file (_MySQL.lua) are correct
    - make sure the MySQL server is accessible from the outside world
